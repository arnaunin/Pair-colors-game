# Memory Game: Find the Pairs! ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¨

This is a classic memory game where you need to find matching pairs of colors. Test your memory and see how quickly you can complete the challenge!

## Description

The **Memory Game** challenges you to uncover all the matching color pairs on a grid. You can customize the grid's size by specifying the number of rows and columns. When you click on a box, its hidden color is revealed. Your task is to find the other box with the same color.

-   **Correct Match:** If you find a pair, both boxes will remain visible, and you can no longer interact with them.
-   **Incorrect Match:** If the colors don't match, the boxes will flip back to their hidden state.

The game continues until you've successfully matched all the pairs. Try to complete it as quickly as possible!
