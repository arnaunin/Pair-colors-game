      <h1>🧠 Memory Game: Find the Pairs! 🎨</h1>
      <p id="instructions">
        Welcome to the <strong>Memory Game</strong>, where your goal is to find all the matching color pairs in the shortest time possible. Enter a number of rows and a number of columns to create the board. When you click on one, its hidden color will be revealed, and you must click on the other box where you think its pair is located. If you guess correctly, both will remain visible and you will no longer be able to interact with them, but if you fail, they will return to their initial state. Continue until you discover all the pairs and complete the challenge as quickly as you can. Test your memory and have fun! 🎨🧠⏳
